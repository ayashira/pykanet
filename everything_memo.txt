=========== 2019/2/17 ============

A first test of kivy+twisted client is implemented.
== Usage ==
1) Run first the server with the following command:
 python test_server.py
2) Launch the client:
 python test_kivy_client.py
 
== Functionalities ==
Text entered in the client textInput is sent to the server,
the server then sends this text back to the client.
When some data is received by the client, it is displayed in the interface.

== Dependencies ==
Tested in Windows anaconda after installing the following dependencies:
pip install twisted kivy kivy.deps.glew kivy.deps.sdl2

== Fonts and Japanese text ==

Kivy default font supports a very limited set of utf8 characters
-> a Noto font added to the project for that
   File is a bit heavy (18M) but this is not a problem for now

Known problem:
Kivy textInput does not display temporary Japanese words when entering some Japanese text
Maybe support of Japanese will be difficult for now (but this is not an urgent problem)

== Code ==
* test_client.py is now useless. Will be removed soon.
* The code of this first client/server test is a bit messy
